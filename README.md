# SoccerNet-XFoul

The SoccerNet-XFoul dataset consists of 22k video-question-answer pairs annotated by more than 70 experienced referees. 
Due to the subjectivity in refereeing, we gathered multiple answers for the same action, rather than collecting a single decision and explanation for each question. In the end, for each action, we have, on average, $1.5$ answers for the same question.

The dataset will be available soon! Stay tunedüî•
