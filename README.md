# X-VARS


In this work, we investigate the capabilities of large language models to explain decisions, using football refereeing as a testing ground, given its decision complexity and subjectivity.
We introduce the EXplainable Video Assistant Referee System, X-VARS, a multi-modal large language model designed for understanding football videos from the point of view of a referee. 
X-VARS can perform a multitude of tasks, including video description, question answering, action recognition, and conducting meaningful conversations based on video content and in accordance with the Laws of the Game for football referees.

This repository contains: 
- SoccerNet-XFoul, a novel dataset consisting of more than 22k video-question-answer triplets annotated by over 70 experienced football referees. 
- X-VARS, a new vision language model that can perform multiple multi-modal tasks such as visual captioning, question-answering, video action recognition, and can generate explanations of its decisions on-par with human level.
- The code to run an offline demo.
