This repository contains: 
- SoccerNet-XFoul, a novel dataset consisting of more than 22k video-question-answer triplets annotated by over 70 experienced football referees. 
- X-VARS, a new vision language model that can perform multiple multi-modal tasks such as visual captioning, question-answering, video action recognition, and can generate explanations of its decisions on-par with human level.
- The code to run an offline demo.


# SoccerNet-XFoul

The SoccerNet-XFoul dataset consists of 22k video-question-answer pairs annotated by more than 70 experienced referees. 
Due to the subjectivity in refereeing, we gathered multiple answers for the same action, rather than collecting a single decision and explanation for each question. In the end, for each action, we have, on average, $1.5$ answers for the same question.
