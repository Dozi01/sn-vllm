# Download weights

Download the [base_model_videoChatGPT](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UbMAQVFrTB-DtEFUSmv8tBXuurrBfMUJ) weights. We use the [Video-ChatGPT](https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/Video-ChatGPT/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file) multi-modal language model as our foundation.
Save the weights in "X-VARS/X-VARS".
